# NonMarkovian Methods

This package has a a goal to collect some of the alternative approaches to open quantum systems into one package with unified notation

for now it only supports the cumulant equation the API documentation can be found in https://gsuarezr.github.io/NonMarkovianMethods/api/

This is undergoing development and major changes are expected, if you find it useful and use it in your research please cite [ Dynamics of the Non-equilibrium spin Boson Model: A Benchmark of master equations and their validity ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04488)
